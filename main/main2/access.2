NAME
    access

SYNOPSIS
    #include <unistd.h>

    int access(const char *pathname, int mode);

DESCRIPTION
    The Access function verifies existence and access authorizations to the file specified by the pathname parameter. 
    The information to be checked must be specified in the amode parameter.
    Note: It is possible to test several permissions simultaneously by combining them using the binary operator |. 
    For example, to test the existence and permission of reading, we will use F_ok | R_ok.

PARAMETERS
    Pathname: This parameter allows you to indicate the file for which to carry out the checks.
    Amode: an integer that represents the mode of access to test. He can take one of the following values:
            F_ok: Test the existence of the file. 
            R_ok: Test the reading permission.
            W_ok: Test the writing permission.
            X_ok: Test the execution permission.

RETURN VALUE
    The Access function returns 0 if access to the file is authorized according to the specified access mode. 
    If access is refused or if an error has occurred, the function returns -1. 
    If an error is noted, the ERRNO variable will be fixed with the error code noted.

ERRORS
    EACCES: Access to the file is refused due to access restrictions.
    EFAULT: The pathname pointer specified in a parameter points outside the authorized address space.
    EINTR: The value of the amode parameter is invalid.
    ELOOP: The specified path contains a circular reference, certainly through a symbolic link.
    ENAMETOOLONG: The specified path exceeds path_max characters, or one of its constituent elements exceeds Name_max.
    ENOENT: The specified path does not exist.
    ENOMEM: There is no longer enough memory for the nucleus.
    ENOTDIR: one of the elements of the specified path is not a file.
    EROFS: writing access is requested on a Read-Only file system.
